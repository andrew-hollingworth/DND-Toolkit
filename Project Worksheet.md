## API

My API will be self-built. Users will be able to save, view, edit, and delete their account info and their DM screens. 

My MVP includes 3 types of data, with room to expand to additional datasets if time allows.

## MVP
- A responsive website with a Ruby on Rails backend and React frontend.
- Clean Material-UI design.
- Users have the ability to login, logout, edit, and delete their profiles.
- Users have the ability to create their own DM Screen and select rules to be included in their screens.
  - I will begin with 3 sections of rules to be included in my MVP (designed to expand post-MVP): 
    - Combat
    - Ability Checks
    - Rest

## PostMVP 

- Drag 'N Drop to sort order of information.
- Search (across datatypes)?
- Add datasets. Each dataset needs to be rendered differently, so this scales exponentially.
  - Conditions
  - Spells
  - Traps
  - Monsters
  - Movement
  - etc.

## Additional Libraries
Axios, Rails, Material-Ui, React-Router-Dom, Postgres, Cors
